# URL Shortener

This project implements a simple URL shortener using Python. It leverages the `pyshorteners` library to create a shortened version of a given URL and the `pyperclip` library to handle clipboard functionality. The program takes user input for a URL and outputs the shortened link.

## Features

- **URL Shortening**: Enter any URL, and the program will return a shortened version using the TinyURL service.
- **User Input**: The program prompts the user to input a URL.
- **Clipboard Support**: The shortened URL can be copied to the clipboard for easy sharing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pyshorteners` library
- `pyperclip` library

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip:

pip install pyshorteners
pip install pyperclip

# Future Improvements
Web Application: Expand this functionality into a web app using Django or Flask.
Custom Short URLs: Allow users to create custom short URLs.
Analytics: Implement tracking for how many times each short URL is accessed.
